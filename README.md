# X4_AddMoney

X4 Foundations any version

Adds credits to the player without the use of a mod. Simply run and become rich.  

The parameter used to invoke the AddPlayerMoney functions is an unknown 8 byte type, at this time. Might be a pointer to something because the money value given to the player is huge.  

Ex: 0x0x51F4D5C00 is around 22 billion  
Roughly the same amount given.
